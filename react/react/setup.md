# ✅ Complete Setup Guide: Node.js, npm, and React (with Vite)

This guide will walk you through installing:
1. Node.js
2. npm (comes with Node)
3. React using Vite (modern and fast)

---

## ✅ 1. Install Node.js (Includes npm)

### 🔹 Step 1: Download Node.js
Go to:
https://nodejs.org

Download the **LTS (Long Term Support)** version.

- ✅ Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- ✅ npm is included automatically

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Verify Installation

Open your terminal / command prompt and run:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## ✅ 2. Install React
``` npm create vite@latest my-react-app```

Inside the installation, select React, then JavaScript (or if you prefer, TypeScript). On "Install with npm and start now", select yes and the app will be up. The rolldown question is irrelevant to the success of our app for now, so select whatever there.

To run our new app, run the following command:
```npm run build``` to build the app, then ```npm run dev```. 

That would be it.
