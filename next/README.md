This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

### BE CAREFUL! DO NOT RUN `npx create-next-app@latest` AS INSTRUCTED IN THE DOCS.

Why? Because Next.js 16 is still unstable and does not behave consistently. For example, it has problems with the Tailwind Intellisense. We will stary on **Next.js 14** for the tutorials. At home, and for the projects, feel free to play around with versions.
